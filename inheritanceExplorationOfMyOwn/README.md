#Exploration of java inheritance
##Casting
If a method is declared in both super and sub class, casting the sub class to super class and call the method will invoke the method in sub class.
On the other hand, casting from sub class to super class is prohibited (most of the time)

##Final
A final method in superclass can be overriden by the final method with same subclass.
Non final method in a super class can have a final method in the subclass with the same name.
